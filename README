Statistics-PCA-Varimax version 0.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Varimax rotation is a change of coordinates used in principal component analysis and factor analysis that maximizes the
sum of the variances of the squared loadings matrix. This module exports a single routine 'rotate'. This routine is
called in LIST context and accepts a LIST-of-LISTS (LoL) corresponding to the loadings matrix of a factor analysis and
returns two references to LoLs. The first is a LoL of the rotated loadings and the seconds is a LoL of the orthogonal
matrix. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varimax_rotation.
